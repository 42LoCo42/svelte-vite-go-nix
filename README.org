Trying out:
- [[https://svelte.dev/][Svelte]] as the frontend, with...
- [[https://vite.dev/][Vite]] as the builder & dev server
- [[https://echo.labstack.com/][Echo]] as the backend
- and [[https://nixos.org/][Nix]] to manage the whole thing

woah that's a lot of stuff!

for development:
#+begin_src shell
  nix shell # or use nix-direnv
  dev       # runs vite & air
#+end_src

for production:
#+begin_src shell
  nix build
#+end_src

as it should be!

** Interesting things to look at
- [[file:vite.config.ts]] - =/api= requests are proxied to the backend server
- [[file:config.prod.go][config.prod.go]] - in production builds, the compiled frontend gets embedded here
